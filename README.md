Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, and it was released in 1995. James Gosling initially developed Java in Sun Microsystems (which was later merged with Oracle Corporation ). Java is a set of features of C and C++ with some essential additional concepts. Java is well suited for both standalone and web application development and is designed to provide solutions to most of the problems faced by users of the internet era.

# Where is Java Used ? -
Earlier Java was only used to design and program small computing devices, but it was later adopted as one of the platform-independent programming languages, and now according to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java.

Java is one of the most important programming languages in today's IT industries.

* JSP - In Java, JSP (Java Server Pages) is used to create dynamic web pages, such as in PHP and ASP.
* Applets - Applets are another type of Java programs that are implemented on Internet browsers and are always run as part of a web document.
* J2EE - Java 2 Enterprise Edition is a platform-independent environment that is a set of different protocols and APIs and is used by various organizations to transfer data between each other.
* JavaBeans - This is a set of reusable software components that can be easily used to create new and advanced applications.
* Mobile - In addition to the above technology, Java is widely used in mobile devices nowadays, many types of games and applications are being made in Java.
* Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.
* Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)
* The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the byte code runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.
* Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.
* Java is used in all kinds of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java-based), desktop applications, web applications, client-server applications, enterprise applications, and many more.
* When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many things which may lead to bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example, non-primitives are always references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to functions, we always pass references in Java. One more example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access is also not possible.
* When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs are written in Java typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does static type checking, but Python does not.

# Simple Hello World Program :-

// A Java program to print "Hello World" 
public class GFG { 

    public static void main(String args[]) 
    
    { 
    
        System.out.println("Hello World"); 
        
    } 
    
}

* Output:-

"Hello World"
